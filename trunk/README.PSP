To make DaedalusX64 for the PSP in linux:

First you need to make the mediaengine.prx. Doing so will also make a
file required by the emulator. You must make this before making the
emulator or you'll get a file not found error.

cd Source/SysPSP/MediaEnginePRX
make


Now just cd back to the root directory and make the emulator.

cd ../../..
make

To make in Windows: Read README.txt
